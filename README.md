# Deploy and Monitor a Machine Learning Workflow for Image Classification

 In this project, I developed an event-driven machine learning (ML) workflow that seamlessly integrates into Scones Unlimited's production architecture. By leveraging the SageMaker Estimator API, I successfully deployed a SageMaker Model and Endpoint. To orchestrate the ML workflow efficiently, AWS Lambda and Step Functions were utilized.

To ensure the robustness and performance of the Endpoint, I employed the SageMaker Model Monitor. This allowed me to instrument and monitor the Endpoint effectively, ensuring its reliability over time. Furthermore, I created a visually appealing visualization that provides stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the Endpoint's performance.

By accomplishing these tasks, I have demonstrated my ability to create and deploy a sophisticated ML workflow, incorporating advanced AWS services, and delivering valuable insights to stakeholders.
